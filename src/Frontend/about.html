        <h3>Identifying the Problem</h3>
        <p>
          HVAC systems have become an integral part of our daily lives, the relationship with air conditioning can last longer than many marriages. However, the interaction between users and these systems has often been complex and unintuitive. In addition to degrading the experience, it also leads to inefficiencies in power consumption and system performance.

        <ul>
          <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Complex Interfaces: Many HVAC systems come with complicated controls that are not user-friendly. AirLink simplifies this with an intuitive chat-based interface. </li>

                  <p>
                    At 20 years old, Bruno Wasserstein has already experienced the rollercoaster of entrepreneurship: he faced two failed projects. But instead of discouraging him, these setbacks only fueled his determination. Each failure became a lesson, teaching him the importance of customer-centricity and the critical role of understanding their needs and pain points.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Bruno's passion is not just limited to business. He is deeply intrigued by psychology and is always curious about the human mind and behavior. This interest led him to undertake a scientific initiation, investigating the influence of data on users. He believes that understanding the psychological aspects of user experience is crucial to creating products that resonate with audiences.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But where does this push toward air conditioning come from? The answer lies in your childhood. Bruno's father, a dedicated HVAC professional who has worked in this field for almost three decades, was his first mentor. At age 6, Bruno was already familiar with advanced HVAC systems such as energy-efficient inverters and VRV. His father instilled in him the values of research, efficiency, and the importance of keeping up with technological advances. HVAC wasn't just a topic of discussion; It has become a way of life. This influenced his decisions, guiding him along a path where he was able to combine his love for technology with the lessons he learned from his father.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Today, with HVAC deeply rooted in his life, Bruno is on a mission. He wants to revolutionize the industry by ensuring that every user has the best experience, combining efficiency with simplicity. The collective is not just a project for him; It is the culmination of his learning and life experiences.
